# tf-idf-Search-Engine

Implements a search engine by defining classes using Python. Creating this search engine as an algorithm that takes a query and retrieves the most relevant documents for that query. This search engine uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), an information statistic for determining the relevance of a term to each document from a corpus consisting of many documents.

tf-idf statistic is a product of two values: term frequency and inverse document frequency.
